## System Architecture

The Drug Repurposing Engine employs a modular, scalable architecture comprising six interconnected core components:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

The platform's foundation is built on comprehensive biomedical data integration through sophisticated pipelines that:

- Extract structured relationships from scientific literature (PubMed, clinical trial databases, patent documents)
- Normalize drug names and properties via RxNorm and PubChem APIs
- Map disease terms to standardized ontologies (UMLS, MeSH, ICD-10)
- Integrate molecular interaction data from ChEMBL, DrugBank, and specialized databases
- Implement real-time updating mechanisms to incorporate new research findings

The ingestion layer employs advanced natural language processing techniques including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and semantic parsing to transform unstructured biomedical text into structured knowledge.

### 2. Knowledge Graph Construction

The core of the system is a multi-modal, heterogeneous knowledge graph that:

- Represents entities (drugs, diseases, genes, proteins, pathways) as nodes
- Captures relationships as semantically labeled, weighted edges
- Incorporates temporal dimensions to track knowledge evolution
- Maintains provenance information for all relationships
- Supports both directed and undirected relationship types

The knowledge graph is implemented through a combination of Neo4j graph database technology and NetworkX computational graph libraries, providing both persistent storage and efficient analytical capabilities.

### 3. Analytical Engine

A sophisticated analytical layer performs complex computation across the knowledge graph:

2. **Network-based Evidence (0-25 points)**
   - Path length between drug and disease
   - Path redundancy (multiple connecting paths)
   - Centrality of intermediate nodes
   - Community co-membership
   - Network-based entity similarity

3. **Mechanism Similarity (0-25 points)**
   - Target protein overlap
   - Pathway involvement correlation

These components are combined into a comprehensive score (0-100) that enables systematic prioritization of repurposing candidates.

### Community Detection

The platform implements multiple community detection algorithms to identify functionally related clusters of biomedical entities:

- **Louvain Method**: Efficient modularity optimization for large-scale graphs
- **Spectral Clustering**: Dimensionality reduction based on graph Laplacian
- **Label Propagation**: Fast, near-linear time algorithm for large networks
- **Infomap**: Information flow-based approach to community identification

These algorithms reveal hidden structures within the knowledge graph, often identifying unexpected clusters that suggest novel repurposing opportunities.

### Node Embedding

Advanced graph embedding techniques transform discrete network structures into continuous vector spaces:

- **Node2Vec**: Random walk-based embeddings with flexible neighborhood sampling
- **Graph Convolutional Networks**: Neural network architectures that operate directly on graph structures
- **TransE/RotatE**: Knowledge graph embeddings that preserve relational semantics
- **BERT-based contextual embeddings**: Integration of textual descriptions with structural information

These embeddings enable similarity calculations, clustering, and predictive modeling in continuous spaces that capture the complex relationships of the knowledge graph.

### Animated Data Flow

A distinctive feature of the platform is its innovative animated data flow visualization:

- Simulates information propagation through the knowledge graph
- Animates the flow of "signals" along network paths
- Highlights active edges during transmission with customizable effects
- Offers configurable animation speed and pulse count
