# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Pushing to your GitHub repository

I see you've already created the repository at `https://github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/DrugReuseEngine`. 

To push this code to your repository:

1. Update the remote URL to match your repository:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/DrugReuseEngine.git
   ```

2. Push the code to your repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. If you encounter permission issues, try these alternatives:
   - Use HTTPS with your GitHub username and personal access token:
     ```
     git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/DrugReuseEngine.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Or download the code as a ZIP file from Replit and upload it manually to GitHub using the web interface.

4. After successful deployment, consider setting up GitHub Pages or connecting your repository to Streamlit Cloud for public hosting.
