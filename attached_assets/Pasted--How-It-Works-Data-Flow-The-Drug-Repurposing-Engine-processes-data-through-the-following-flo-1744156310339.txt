## How It Works

### Data Flow

The Drug Repurposing Engine processes data through the following flow:

1. **Data Collection**: PubMed articles, drug databases, and gene expression datasets are collected through the data ingestion modules.

2. **Data Normalization**: Drug names, disease terms, and gene identifiers are normalized using RxNorm and UMLS mapping.

3. **Text Analysis**: Natural language processing techniques extract drug-disease relationships and potential mechanisms from scientific literature.

4. **Gene Expression Analysis**: Differential gene expression analysis identifies gene signatures associated with diseases and drug responses.

5. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: A comprehensive knowledge graph is built, connecting drugs, diseases, genes, proteins, and biological pathways.

6. **Mechanistic Explanation Generation**: AI models analyze the knowledge graph and other data to generate detailed explanations of potential mechanisms.

7. **Confidence Score Calculation**: Multiple lines of evidence are integrated to calculate confidence scores for repurposing candidates.

8. **Result Presentation**: Results are presented through the user interface and made available through the API.

### Confidence Scoring

Confidence scores are calculated based on multiple factors:

- **Evidence Score**: Based on the quantity and quality of supporting evidence
- **Mechanism Score**: Based on the clarity and plausibility of the proposed mechanism
- **Novelty Score**: Based on the novelty of the repurposing candidate

The overall confidence score is a weighted combination of these factors, with values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph represents entities (drugs, diseases, genes, proteins, pathways) as nodes and relationships between them as edges. Key relationship types include:

- **TREATS**: Drug treats disease
- **CAUSES**: Entity causes disease
- **ASSOCIATED_WITH**: Entity is associated with disease
- **INTERACTS_WITH**: Drug interacts with protein
- **PART_OF**: Entity is part of pathway
- **REGULATES**: Entity regulates another entity
