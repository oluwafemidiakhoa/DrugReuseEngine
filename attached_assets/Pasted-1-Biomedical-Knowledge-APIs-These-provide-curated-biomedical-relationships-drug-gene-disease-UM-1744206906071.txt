1. Biomedical Knowledge APIs
These provide curated biomedical relationships (drug-gene-disease).

UMLS API (Unified Medical Language System) – via UMLS REST API

DrugBank API – drug-target-disease relationships, clinical trials, mechanisms.

Open Targets API – for drug-target-disease associations using evidence-based scoring.

DisGeNET API – gene-disease associations.

Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) API – chemical-gene-disease interactions.

NCBI E-utilities – access PubMed, gene, and compound data (e.g., via Entrez).

2. Drug, Chemical, and Compound APIs
For structures, repurposing candidates, or interaction data.

PubChem REST API – chemical structure, bioactivity, and assay data.

ChEMBL API – bioactivity data, drug-target interaction data.

BindingDB API – experimental binding affinities for drug-targets.

RxNorm API – drug normalization, synonym mapping.

3. Clinical and Regulatory Data
Track approvals, label info, side effects, and adverse events.

OpenFDA API – access clinical trials, drug labels, adverse events.

ClinicalTrials.gov API – ongoing and past trials, outcomes, phases.

EMA & FDA Drug Approval Databases (via scraping or third-party APIs).

SIDER Database (via manual ingestion or scraping) – side effect data.

4. Gene & Pathway APIs
Link drug mechanisms to pathways and molecular functions.

MyGene.info API – gene annotations.

Reactome API – pathways and molecular interactions.

KEGG API – pathways, gene-drug-disease mappings (can be parsed from REST).

5. Knowledge Graphs & AI Models
To create embeddings, perform reasoning, and generate hypotheses.

BioThings APIs – family of APIs including MyGene, MyVariant, MyChem.

Scibite, Monarch Initiative APIs – semantic graphs and ontologies.

Hugging Face Hub APIs – for models like BioGPT, PubMedBERT, BioLinkBERT.

GroqCloud API – for running large biomedical models like LLaMA3 or BioMedLM.

LangChain + LangGraph + PyG – for GraphRAG and reasoning over graphs.

6. Optional: Commercial & Premium APIs
To boost enterprise-grade insights.

Elsevier APIs (Embeddable ScienceDirect, Scopus) – literature-based discovery.

Clarivate Integrity/ Cortellis APIs – premium drug repurposing and IP data.

IBM Watson Discovery (biomedical corpora) – NLP + document mining.

Next-Level Architecture
To truly advance:

Integrate a Graph Database like Neo4j or TigerGraph with biomedical triples.

Use Graph Machine Learning (PyG) for link prediction on drug-disease nodes.

Use LLMs + GraphRAG for hypothesis generation and reasoning.
